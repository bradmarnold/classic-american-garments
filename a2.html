  <h2>Problem the garment solved</h2>
  <p>When the U.S. Army Air Corps introduced Specification 94‑3040, better known as the A‑2 flight jacket, in 1931, open‑cockpit biplanes had given way to enclosed cockpits at altitude. Pilots still faced frigid temperatures and the risk of entanglement, so they needed a lightweight, waist‑length jacket that offered warmth, mobility and fire resistance. The earlier A‑1 jacket (1927) used a button front and knit collar, but buttons could snag on parachute harnesses and the knit collar didn’t protect the neck from drafts. The A‑2 introduced a sturdy zipper front, a pointed leather collar that could be turned up and snapped down and reinforced epaulets for the rank insignia. The waist‑length cut avoided interference with cockpit controls. Unlike heavy shearling B‑3 bombers, the A‑2 used thinner leather to allow movement while still insulating against cold.</p>

  <h2>Timeline and naming</h2>
  <p>The A‑2 remained standard issue for U.S. Army Air Forces pilots from 1931 until 1943. Early contracts were filled by multiple manufacturers – Rough Wear, Aero Leather, Cable Raincoat and others – leading to slight variations in cut, collar shape and pocket placement. World War II saw tens of thousands produced. In 1943 the A‑2 was replaced by cloth jackets like the B‑10 and B‑15 due to cost and the need for more insulation at high altitudes. However, many pilots continued to wear their A‑2s, and the jacket became a prized souvenir and symbol of service. The U.S. Air Force re‑issued a modernised A‑2 in the 1980s for officers; commercial makers like Cockpit, Avirex and Eastman continue to produce replicas based on specific wartime contracts.</p>

  <h2>Anatomy</h2>
  <p>A typical A‑2 is a trim, waist‑length leather jacket with a one‑piece back (no centre seam) and a two‑piece front with a heavy brass zipper covered by a stitched wind flap. Two bellows patch pockets with scalloped flaps and snap closures sit low on the front; they may have hand‑warmer openings in later versions. The collar is made from a single piece of leather with a stand, able to be snapped down at the tips to prevent wind flapping. The jacket’s waist and cuffs are made of knitted wool ribbing, which seals out drafts. Epaulets on the shoulders can carry rank insignia. The lining is often lightweight cotton or silk, though some wartime examples use rayon. Inside, a hanging loop and size/spec label identify the contract number and maker. There are no side pockets or belts, and the silhouette hugs the body.</p>

  <h2>Draft recipe</h2>
  <p>Drafting an A‑2 pattern begins with a fitted jacket block. Draft the back as a single piece with a slight curve at the waist to accommodate ribbing; exclude centre seams to mimic original specs. The front consists of two panels with dart control at the chest; extend the front down to include the bellows pockets, which have three sides pleated to allow expansion. The pocket flaps are cut as scallops that align with the pocket width; include a snap placement near the point. Draft a separate wind flap to sew along the right front zipper; it should cover the zipper completely. The collar is drafted as a one‑piece point collar with a stand; add snaps at the tips. Sleeves are two‑piece with a slight curve for arm articulation. The knit waistband is drafted smaller than the jacket waist to create a snug fit; the cuffs are similarly drafted. Include 1 cm seam allowances and mark top‑stitching lines.</p>

  <h2>Construction logic</h2>
  <p>Leather requires different sewing techniques than denim. Seams are typically butted or lapped and then top‑stitched; they cannot be ripped and re‑sewn because needle holes remain. A heavy‑duty machine with a walking foot is used. The front zipper is sewn to the leather using a zipper tape; the wind flap is top‑stitched to hide the tape. Pocket bellows are pleated and top‑stitched for reinforcement. The collar stand is stiffened with interfacing and glued before stitching to prevent stretching. Knitted wool ribbing is attached at the hem and cuffs by stretching the ribbing to fit the leather, creating a blouson effect. Epaulets are sewn into the shoulder seams and then top‑stitched down. The lining is bagged – sewn to the facings and then turned – and hand‑finished at the sleeve openings.</p>

  <h2>Materials and mills</h2>
  <p>Original A‑2s were made from horsehide tanned to a russet brown. Horsehide is dense and abrasion‑resistant but becomes supple with wear. Later contracts used goatskin or cowhide when horsehide became scarce. The lining was cotton or silk, often in pale salmon or khaki colours. Zippers were made by Talon or Crown with brass teeth. Snaps were nickel‑plated and often stamped with the manufacturer’s name. Knitted ribbing was 100% wool in a matching shade of brown. Wartime shortages sometimes led to mismatches in materials; some jackets have mismatched lining colours or different pocket shapes depending on the manufacturer.</p>

  <h2>Variants and evolution</h2>
  <p>Because multiple companies produced A‑2s, details vary. Some had larger collar stands, others narrower; some placed pockets slightly higher; some used narrower epaulets. Post‑war, the Navy’s M‑422 and later G‑1 jackets adopted a mouton fur collar and an action back with bi‑swing pleats, features absent on A‑2s. Modern reproductions offer lambskin versions that are lighter and softer, often with side entry pockets for convenience. Some companies add interior pockets or quilted linings. Collectors prize jackets with original squadron patches or nose art painted by the wearer. In the 1980s, the Air Force’s new A‑2 omitted the snaps on the collar and added side entry hand‑warmer pockets, modernising the look while retaining the overall silhouette.</p>

  <h2>Stories that show why</h2>
  <p>A‑2 jackets are steeped in mythology because they were literal canvases for pilots’ stories. Flying Tigers pilots in the American Volunteer Group painted Chinese and American flag patches on the back of their jackets so that if they were shot down, locals could identify them. Many bomber crews painted the names of their aircraft – “Memphis Belle,” “Sentimental Journey” – on the back panel along with mission tallies. Legendary pilot Jimmy Doolittle and his crew wore A‑2s during the 1942 Doolittle Raid on Tokyo; photos show them standing on the deck of the USS <em>Hornet</em> with their leather jackets and parachute harnesses. Hollywood immortalised the garment in movies: Gregory Peck wore an A‑2 in <em>Twelve O’Clock High</em> (1949), and Steve McQueen’s character in <em>The Great Escape</em> (1963) wears a brown leather jacket with knit cuffs reminiscent of an A‑2, even though he plays a U.S. Navy pilot.</p>

  <p>After the war, many discharged aviators and soldiers missed the camaraderie of squadron life and formed motorcycle clubs. Surplus flight jackets, including the A‑2 and the later M‑422, became makeshift riding gear. Leather provided wind resistance and some abrasion protection. Early motorcycle gangs like the Boozefighters and Hells Angels wore these jackets with patches that mirrored the nose art of their wartime squadrons. By the late 1940s, New York manufacturer Schott produced the Perfecto motorcycle jacket – inspired by these flight jackets but with an asymmetrical zipper to block wind. Hollywood quickly noticed. Marlon Brando’s Johnny Strabler in <em>The Wild One</em> (1953) wore a black leather Perfecto, cementing the rebellious association. James Dean followed suit in <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em> (1955). These jackets borrowed the blouson silhouette and rugged attitude of the A‑2 but added a more streamlined, biker-friendly cut – a shift as dramatic as the Type III’s evolution from the Type II denim jacket.</p>
