  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>This blog is curated by a sewing enthusiast from Southlake, Texas. I have a deep respect for heritage clothing and love to explore the intersection of pattern drafting and history. Through this blog, I hope to help fellow makers understand the 'why' behind classic garments and how to recreate them with authenticity. I'm fascinated by the stories clothes tell—how a rivet or a seam can reveal a moment in time—and I enjoy sharing those narratives alongside practical drafting tips.</p>
